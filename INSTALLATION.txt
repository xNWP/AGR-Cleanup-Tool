== USAGE ==

Open the plugin under the plugins menu, then select a function to use.

# Delete Hitboxes/Physics Objects
The plugin will attempt to find any physics/hitbox objects and delete them,
since this action is destructive it can be undone in the edit menu.

# Fix Ball Joint Rotations
The plugin will focus the camera onto a balljoint, you can then rotate the balljoint
using the edit fields, and the quick 45 degree movements.
You can change the time by sliding the frame slider at the top of the window.
You can also change the camera rotation by adjusting Ï„ (Tau), and the camera height by adjusting h.
Any changes made can not be undone !!!
